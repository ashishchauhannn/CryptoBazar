1. Frontend Architecture
Framework: Vite with React.js

Components:

Homepage Component:
Cryptocurrency List: Displays a list of cryptocurrencies with their logos.
Current Value Display: Shows the current traded value per coin.
Price Change Indicators: Indicates the net rise/fall in prices over the last 24 hours and 7 days with appropriate coloring (e.g., green for rise, red for fall).
CryptoConverter Component:
Conversion Form: Allows users to convert from one cryptocurrency to another.
API Integration: Utilizes the CoinMarketCap API to fetch real-time cryptocurrency data.
Routing: React Router for navigating between the Homepage and CryptoConverter pages.

State Management: Redux or Context API for managing global state, such as user preferences and fetched cryptocurrency data.

Styling: CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled-Components or Tailwind CSS for responsive and mobile-first design.

2. Backend Architecture
Server: Node.js with Express.js

API Integration:

CoinMarketCap API: Fetches real-time cryptocurrency data.
Endpoints:
https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/: Fetches the list of cryptocurrencies and their current values.

Database: MongoDB (or any NoSQL database) for storing user data, preferences, and historical data.

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication and session management.

3. Data Flow
User Interaction:
Users interact with the frontend components (Homepage and CryptoConverter).
Actions like viewing cryptocurrency lists or converting currencies trigger API calls.
API Requests:
The frontend makes HTTP requests to the backend server.
The backend server processes these requests and interacts with the CoinMarketCap API to fetch the required data.
Data Processing:
The backend processes the data received from the CoinMarketCap API.
It formats the data and sends it back to the frontend.
State Management:
The frontend updates the global state with the fetched data.
Components re-render to display the updated information.
4. Deployment
Hosting:

Frontend: Vercel.

CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions or any CI/CD tool for automated testing and deployment.

5. Security
HTTPS: Ensure all communications between the client and server are encrypted.

Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse.

Input Validation: Validate all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.

6. Performance Optimization
Caching: Use caching mechanisms like Redis to store frequently accessed data.

Lazy Loading: Implement lazy loading for components and data to improve performance.

Code Splitting: Use code splitting to load only the necessary JavaScript bundles.

7. Monitoring and Analytics
Monitoring: Use tools like New Relic or Datadog to monitor application performance.

Analytics: Integrate Google Analytics or similar tools to track user interactions and behavior.
